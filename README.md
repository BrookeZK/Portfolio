## Description

_This is my first personal project using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with the goal of creating a personal portfolio website. The main page is an introduction including my name, a description, an image and a menu with two links. The first link takes you to aboutme.html, where I give a mission statement, write about my background, hobbies and interests. The second link takes you to projects.html, where I showcase the coding projects I have worked on, giving descriptions and links to their repositories. Enjoy._
