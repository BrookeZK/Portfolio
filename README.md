# _Portfolio_

#### _A Portfolio Website for Brooke Kullberg's programming projects - March 22, 2019_

#### By _**Brooke Kullberg**_

## Description

_This is my first personal project with the goal of creating a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main page is index.html; it includes my name, a description of the web page, an photo of myself, and a menu with two links. The first link takes you to aboutme.html, where I give a mission statement, write about my background, hobbies, and interests. The second link takes you to projects.html, where I showcase the coding projects I have worked on, giving descriptions and links to their GitHub repositories. Enjoy._

## Setup/Installation Requirements - Option 1
* _Open the website by typing in the following link into your web browser: <https://BrookeZK.github.io/Portfolio>._
