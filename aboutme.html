                <div class="panel-body">
                  <p><strong>I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon,</strong> branching out of my home town first in my move to Eugene to attend the University of Oregon, then to Valparaiso, Chile for a year to study abroad.</p>
                  <p>College was important to my formation. It gave me a chance to explore many interests: <strong>Philosophy, business, language acquisition and teaching, and Spanish.</strong> It also connected to many groups of people: artists, academics, punks, travelers, musicians, activists. In short, my horizons were broadened. What I learned propelled me to my first step into adulthood and a post-college life.</p>
                  <p>Naturally, I hit the road after graduation, <strong>traveling across country, and the world,</strong> funding myself through seasonal work, the piecemeal hustle of trimming weed. It was tedious, hard on the body and very boring. Excitment came when you weren't sure you were going to be paid, when you weren't sure where the gunshots were coming from and why, and when you weren't sure who had work, who was trustworth. I appreciated the adventure, didn't get hurt, but the work was not sustainable or interesting.</p>
                  <p>And neither was constantly traveling. Even though it is one of my biggest passions, I knew that if I did not have a home base or a career I would feel neither realized nor stable. Two years after I graduated college, <strong>I turned towards building a satisfying career</strong>. I've always enjoyed working with my hands and building things, so I pursued a career in construciton. I picked up contractor work, became a painter, and then a welder at an industrial manufacturing plant. I came to know my body's limits quickly, seeing that I could not sustain a career in physical labor.</p>
                  <p><strong>At another dead end,</strong> I thoughtfully considered pursuing computer programming. Knowing a handful of people in the field, I picked their brains, and asked about their lifestyles. Coding could be fun, I thought. So here I am, on my first step down this path. As of yet, I am very happy with my desicion and look forward to filling up my Portfolio with more and more projects!</p>

                  <p><strong>With regards to coding,</strong> I am still exploring my interests. I think I would like the style part of front-end development, but also would be fascinated by the back-end data crunching and structure side of programs. <strong>Some of my personal projects are:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Creating a business website using HTML and CSS for my friend's tattoo business</li>
                    <li>Making a choose-your-own-adventure game with my junior programmer friend</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>My personal interests</strong> are quite varied. I am passionate about health and wellness. I love to learn new languages, currently in a slow struggle with Russian. I am an avid jogger and bicylist. Travel and meeting people is one of my top interests. I also like to learn about new topics, across the board, about any aspect of life. I love fashion and considered becoming a designer for a while.</p>
                  <p><strong>When I have free time, I like to...</strong></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Play with my cat</li>
                    <li>Take care of my plants</li>
                    <li>Read, especially sci-fi!</li>
                    <li>See friends, go on mini-trips out of town</li>
                    <li>Make home made meals</li>
                    <li>Work on my truck!</li>
